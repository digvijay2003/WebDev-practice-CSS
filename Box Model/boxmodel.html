     <div id="one">Even students who are just learning to write, such as kindergartners, can benefit from understanding the structure of a paragraph. As they progress into the later years of elementary school and middle school, they can begin to create paragraphs that include all of the necessary elements. Once a student reaches high school, they should be able to write a paragraph that has a distinct thesis and also includes supporting arguments.</div>

     <div id="two">Write a paragraph about an important person in history. Be sure to address the topic of the paragraph, such as that person’s career, birthplace or prominent contribution. Use supporting sentences to expand on the topic chosen.</div>

     <div id="three">Recently I had the opportunity to attend a conference with an old friend. The conference was at a relatively remote, logistically inconvenient campus. So we made the best of it. On my own way up from western North Carolina through the Shenandoah Valley and onward to our destination, I detoured off my route, picked him up at a regional airport, and we turned the rest of the journey into a road trip.</div>
     
     <div id="four">The time in the car afforded us a much-needed opportunity to catch up socially, but also to update one another on our scholarly projects. Like many people, we both have a tendency to be very good at starting projects, but are not always as adept or timely about finishing them. Now that we live in different cities, it is a little harder for us to hold one another’s feet to the fire, as we had in the past.</div>
